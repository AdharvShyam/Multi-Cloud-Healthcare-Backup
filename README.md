# Multi-Cloud Hybrid Strategy for Healthcare

## Project Overview
This project simulates a multi-cloud backup strategy for healthcare data using Python.  
It demonstrates how critical healthcare documents can be backed up across multiple storage locations to ensure data safety and system reliability.

The system implements redundancy and failover mechanisms by storing healthcare files in both local storage and cloud storage.

## Objectives
- Simulate a healthcare data backup system
- Implement multi-source backup using Python
- Demonstrate redundancy and failover concepts
- Ensure data safety using local and cloud storage

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Drive API
- Local Storage
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code
